<h1>The Best Movies According to Edo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>John Ford. John Wayne. History.</h3>
<p>
  "Stagecoach" is a film in which two great careers were renewed. Although he
  had appeared before in many films, as an extra, a stuntman and then an actor
  in B films, this was John Wayne's first starring role in a film by John Ford.
  For Ford, it was a return after some years to a genre about which his ideas
  had grown--the genre in which he would make many of his greatest films. With
  Ford's clout as a director and Wayne's clout as a star, they would make iconic
  films and establish themselves as one of the legendary partnerships in cinema.

<h3>A sermon written in blood</h3>
<p>
  It is almost always raining in the city. Somerset, the veteran detective,
  wears a hat and raincoat. Mills, the kid who has just been transferred into
  the district, walks bare-headed in the rain as if he'll be young forever. On
  their first day together, they investigate the death of a fat man they find
  face-down in a dish of pasta. On a return visit to the scene, the beams of
  their flashlights point here and there in the filthy apartment, picking out a
  shelf lined with dozens of cans of Campbell's Tomato Sauce. Not even a fat man
  buys that much tomato sauce.

<h3>He just wanted to become a real boy</h3>
<p>
  Stanley Kubrick always referred to the story as "Pinocchio." It mirrored the
  tale of a puppet who dreams of becoming a real boy. And what, after all, is an
  android but a puppet with a computer program pulling its strings? The project
  that eventually became Steven Spielberg's "A. I. Artificial Intelligence"
  (2001) was abandoned by Kubrick because he wasn't satisfied with his
  approaches to its central character, David, an android who appears to be a
  real little boy. Believing special effects wouldn't be adequate and a human
  actor would seem too human, he turned the project over to his friend
  Spielberg. Legend has it he made that decision after being impressed by
  Spielberg's special effects in "Jurassic Park," but perhaps "E. T." was also
  an influence: If Spielberg could create an alien who evoked human emotions,
  could he do the same with an android?
